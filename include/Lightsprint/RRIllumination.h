	//! Data structure with object's illumination and more.
	//
	//! This is collection of various buffers that may contain
	//! lightmaps, bent normals, reflection cube maps, ambient occlusion.
	//! This collection belongs to one object in your scene.
	//!
	//! Buffers are created by you and deleted by destructor (unless you delete them manually).
	//!
	//! RRSolver::updateXxx() functions store calculated illumination in buffers.
	//! They usually preserve buffer properties you selected while creating buffer:
	//! BufferType, BufferFormat and scale. So you are free to select between per-pixel
	//! and per-vertex lighting etc.
	//!
	//! Renderer renders illumination from these buffers.

		//! Illumination can be stored in various types of buffers
		//! - vertex colors (vertex buffer)
		//! - lightmap (2d texture)
		//! - reflection map (cube texture).
		//!
		//! At the beginning, all layers are empty, buffers are NULL. To initialize layer, do one of
		//! - do nothing (keep them NULL) for no illumination
		//! - allocate buffers automatically by allocateBuffersForRealtimeGI()
		//! - allocate buffers manually by getLayer() = RRBuffer::create().
		//!   For cubemap, reasonable initialization is RRBuffer::create(BT_CUBE_TEXTURE,16,16,6,BF_RGBA,true,NULL).
		//!   Note that BF_RGBF would preserves intensities above 1 better, but very old GPUs don't support float filtering
		//!   and GF7100 even switches to sw render (extremely slow).
		//!   BF_RGBA usually looks ok and it doesn't have any compatibility problems.
		//!   Size doesn't have to be power of two.
		//!
		//! To update buffers in layer, do one of
		//! - manually by updateLightmap() or updateLightmaps()
		//! - manually by updateEnvironmentMap()
		//! - automatically by calling renderer with updateLightIndirect=true
		//!
		//! Multiple layers (e.g. one layer per light source) can be mixed by renderer.
		//!
		//! Assigned buffers will be deleted automatically in ~RRObjectIllumination.

		//!  Index of illumination buffer you would like to get. Arbitrary unsigned number.

	//! GI precomputed in space
	//
	//! Light field contains precomputed indirect part of global illumination.
	//! It is designed for scenarios with static lights and dynamic objects -
	//! precompute lightmaps for static objects and lightfield for dynamic objects.
	//! When rendering dynamic objects in game, use your usual
	//! direct lighting together with indirect lighting from lightfield.
	//! You can use multiple lightfields for different locations in game level.
	//!
	//! Typical use:
	//! - RRSolver::buildLightField() - create new instance in game editor
	//! - RRLightField::save() - save it in game editor
	//! - RRLightField::load() - load instance in game
	//! - RRLightField::updateEnvironmentMap() - use instance in game
