-------

AmbientOcclusion
- precalculates ambient occlusion with infinite light bounces and color bleeding
- optional viewer of object/scene and ambient occlusion map
- loads Collada scene

BunnyBenchmark
- measures Collider score in Stanford Bunny Benchmark

HelloCollider
- shows how to detect ray-mesh collision

HelloMesh
- shows how to create mesh

HelloDemoEngine
- shows how to render realtime direct illumination in scene with dynamic objects and light

HelloRealtimeRadiosity
- shows how to render realtime global illumination in scene with dynamic objects and light
- shows feeding external 3ds renderer with Lightsprint computed illumination
- loads 3ds scene

HelloVision
- shows how to calculate static illumination in scene, without renderer

Lightmaps
- realtime global illumination preview (1 light only)
- on request: precalculates lightmaps/vertexcolors from all types of lights (point/spot/dir/skybox)
- uses internal renderer
- loads Collada scene

Water
- simple use of DemoEngine, renders skybox and water
