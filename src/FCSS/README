
  FAST CORRECT SOFT SHADOWS for NVIDIA GPUs
  -----------------------------------------

  This work is based on Mark J. Kilgard's shadow mapping example,
  see original README_MJK.


  What was added
  --------------

* mgf scene loader + Peter Shirley's scenes
  (default: scene10, 83k triangles, 167k vertices)
  (to compile, download mgflib from http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html)
* soft shadows by combining any number of hard shadows
  linear, circular, rectangular lightsource
  (default: linear, change by 'g', 6 lights, change by '+'/'-')
* combining done by blending or accumulation buffer
  (default: blending, toggle by: 'A')
* removed rear lighting, light changed to spotlight
  (attenuation map in: spot0.tga)
* glstuff.h replaced by glprocs.c/h (-> more extensions)


  What was broken
  ---------------

* dual-pass shadow mapping
  (not hard to fix, but there is probably no demand)
  thus GF3 or higher is required


  Notes
  -----

  Default number of ligts is quite low (6) due to blending artifacts.
  If your hardware supports acumulation buffer, 
  switch from blending to accumulation buffer (by 'A')
  and increase number of lights (by '+')
  to get smoother shadows.


  Performance
  -----------

  fps with default settings and cmdline argument "-novsync", measured by F7
  on nVidia GF4Ti 4200 (XP1700), drivers 61.77, scene10

            -nodlist  default
  default       4        23
  -arrays1      8        19
  -arrays2      6        5

  scene10 details:
   41800 quads -> 83600 triangles, 167200 vertices
   when whole scene fits into viewport, fps drops from 23 to 16fps
   scene is rendered 13x in one frame
   -> processing approx 17M triangles/sec, 35M vertices/sec
   speed is probably vertex limited
