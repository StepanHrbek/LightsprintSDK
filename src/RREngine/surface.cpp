1-sided vs 2-sided surface

Expected behaviour:

 Exactly as mgfdoc specifies.

 What does mgfdoc say:

 The sides entity is used to set the number of sides for the current material.
 If a surface is two-sided, then it will appear
 identical when viewed from either the front or the back.
 If a surface is one-sided,
 then it appears invisible when viewed from the back side.
 This means
 that a transmitting object will affect the light coming in through the
 front surface and ignore the characteristics of the back surface,
 unless the index of refraction is set.
 If the index of refraction is set, then the object will act as a
 solid piece of dielectric material.
 In either case, the transmission properties of the exiting surface
 should be the same as the incident surface for the model to be
 physically valid.
 The default number of sides is two.

Real behaviour:

 I'm not sure if I understand it.
 Let's independently specify our behaviour:

 1. 1-sided surface is surface of solid object from real world.
    If it has no transmittance, surface can't be hit from the inner side.
    (=There is darkness inside real world solid objects.)
    But if it happens, energy should be thrown away and ray discontinued.
    Presence of such rays may be visualised by
    -sides1outer:receive=0 -sides1inner:receive=1 -sides2outer:receive=0 -sides2inner:receive=0

    Let's imagine some possibilities:
      a) rays that hit inner side are thrown away
      b) rays that hit inner side continue as if nothing happened

    Our implementation makes a) by default.
    b) is available by -sides1inner:catch=0

 2. There is no 2-sided surface in real world.
    2-sided is probably something solid, thin object with >0 thickness.
    Or CG hack without real-world sense.
    What if we have 2-sided surface enlightened only from one side?

    Let's imagine possibilities how to handle it:
      a) dark from the other side (thin metal layer)
      b) equally enlightened from (and emiting to) both sides (thin cloth)
      c) appear equally enlightened from both sides but emit light only to outer side (CG hack)

    Our implementation makes c) by default.
    b) is available by -sides2inner:emit=1
    a) would require some coding and more memory
