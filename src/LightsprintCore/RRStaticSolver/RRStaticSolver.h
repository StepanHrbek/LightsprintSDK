	//  RRStaticSolver
	//! 3d scene where illumination can be calculated.
	//
	//! %RRStaticSolver covers the most important functionality of library -
	//! illumination calculation. It allows you to setup multiple objects in space,
	//! setup other states that affect calculations, perform calculations
	//! and read back results.
	//!
	//! Common scenario is to perform calculations while allowing 
	//! user to continue work and see illumination improving on the background.
	//! This could be done by inserting following code into your main loop
	//! \code
	//    if (!paused) {
	//      scene->illuminationImprove(endIfUserWantsToInteract);
	//      if (once a while) read back results using scene->getTriangleMeasure();
	//    } \endcode
	//! \n For smooth integration without feel of slowing down, it is good to pause 
	//! calculation after each user interaction and resume it again once there is
	//! no user interaction for at least 0.5 sec.
	//! \n When user modifies scene, calculation may be restarted using illuminationReset().
	//!  For scenes small enough, this creates global illumination in dynamic scene 
	//!  with full interactivity.
	//!
	//! Thread safe: It is legal to create multiple scenes and
	//!  use them in parallel, in multiple threads.
	//!  It is legal to read results from one scene in multiple threads at once.
	//!  It is not allowed to calculate in one scene in multiple threads at once.
