		MGF Parser Library Version 2.0
		SCCSid "@(#)README 1.4 3/18/97 LBL"

Welcome to the second major release of the MGF language and parser library.
If you have not read it already, you should take a look at the documentation
in the troff file "mgfdoc.tr".  This can be printed out using the -ms
macro package, or by sending the file "mgfdoc.ps" to a PostScript printer.
The figures for this document are contained in "figures.ps", which may
also be sent to a PostScript printer, or displayed with ghostview (if you
have it).

Most of the source files go directly into the parser library, with
the following exceptions:

	face2tri.C	- C++ converter from polygons to triangles
	mgf2inv.c	- MGF to Inventor converter, complete
	mgf2rad.c	- MGF to Radiance converter, missing some libraries
	mgfilt.c	- MGF to MGF filter, compiled in Makefile
	rad2mgf.c	- Radiance to MGF converter, missing some libraries
	3ds2mgf.c	- 3D-Studio to MGF converter, complete with below
	optray.[ch]	- Triangle smoothing code used by 3ds2mgf
	vect.[ch]	- Vector and matrix code used by 3ds2mgf

The Makefile creates three useful items:

	mgfilt		- a filter for MGF
	libmgf.a	- the MGF parser library
	mgf2inv		- a translator from MGF to Inventor (or VRML) format
	3ds2mgf		- a translator from 3D-Studio to MGF

Before you compile, you should probably check to make sure that the
compiler and flags you like are included.  If you're like me and lack
an ANSII-compatible C compiler on your machine, use the -DNOPROTO flag
to take out function prototypes and get back K&R compatibility.

The exception to this is 3ds2mgf, which requires an ANSI-C compiler with
prototypes.  Because of this requirement, the program must be built
explicitly with "make 3ds2mgf".
