This is mostly historical, from era of closed source. Has pictures.

# History
I was firm believer in open source, but I did not believe in open source business models. So Lightsprint SDK has been closed source and it did modestly feed my family for 17 years. This era is gone.

You can see git history from 2005. It has been filtered, removing customer data, game engine integrations etc. If you spot anything that should not be here, please let me know.

# Plans
I plan to have fun.

If there are users in need of support, I'll help. But as this is open for one day and I did not tell anyone, there are no users yet.

My initial plan is to clean up [Lightsmark](https://dee.cz/lightsmark) and release it once more.
The engine is much better since 2008, my 4 years old GPU renders the same scene smoothly at like 5000fps, with global illumination updated in every frame.

- Windows platform works well.
- Linux should be good or nearly good, did not test in several years.
- OSX worked well for a decade, but I have no Mac anymore.
- Android port has not been finished. Not sure what it needs.
- MorphOS port is being investigated.

Any contribution is welcome.
