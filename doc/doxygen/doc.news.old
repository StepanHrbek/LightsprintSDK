\section news76 ------------------------------------ 2009.03.14 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- Improved handling of overlapping triangles.
  \n It's still recommended to avoid them, but if you must use them, chances are that precomputed lightmaps will be ok.
  \n Previously \ref main_ue3 "UE3" skylight created dark strips where terrain segments overlap.
- tangent space vectors are displayed in rr_gl::sceneViewer() with helpers enabled

FIXES

\section news75 ------------------------------------ 2009.02.23 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- \ref main_ue3 "UE3 integration" produces higher quality lightmaps in proximity of SpeedTree meshes
  (fixed per-pixel material detection)

NEWS

- emissive multiplier, lets you boost or reduce emissivity in materials
  - new parameter "emissivemultiplier=1" in BuildLightmaps tool
  - new parameter in rr_io::ImportSceneRRLight::ImportSceneRRLight()
  - adapters call new RRMaterial::Property::multiply() to apply emissive multiplier

\section news73 ------------------------------------ 2009.02.06 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- RRLight::rtProjectedTextureFilename
  \n lets you specify texture projected by light

CHANGES

- rr_gl::RealtimeLight::lightDirectMap replaced by
  - rr_gl::RealtimeLight::setProjectedTexture()
  - rr_gl::RealtimeLight::getProjectedTexture()

\section news72 ------------------------------------ 2009.01.10 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- sample BuildLightmaps supports setting sky from commandline (HDR or LDR texture or 6 textures or flat color or upper and lower hemisphere color)
- improved realtime render of float textures
  - uses floats where available, falls back to 8bit on ancient GPUs
  - HDR skyboxes in physical scale are converted to sRGB in shader

FIXED

- Gamebryo adapter allocated too much memory and crashed in some scenes

\section news71 ------------------------------------ 2009.01.08 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- \ref main_ue3 "UE3 integration" produces higher quality lightmaps: now also SpeedTree materials are evaluated per-pixel

CHANGES

- default behaviour of back side of one sided material was changed
  \n Previously, photons that hit back side of one-sided face were removed from simulation. Windows had to be made of 2-sided faces to transmit light in both directions.
  \n Now photons are allowed to go through back side and refract according to material transmittance and refraction index. Windows transmit light in both directions even if they are made of 1-sided faces.

\section news70 ------------------------------------ 2009.01.07 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- \ref main_ue3 "UE3 integration" produces higher quality lightmaps: staticmesh and bspsurface materials are evaluated per-pixel
- 2x faster windowed reporter (RRReporter::createWindowedReporter())
  \n (real world example: building preview quality lightmaps in scene with 11000 meshes and windowed reporter took 600s, now 500s)

CHANGES

- rr_gl::sceneViewer() second parameter removed (bool createWindow)
  \n window is always created, false was ignored since sceneViewer rewrite in 2008.12.8

  - RRChanneledData removed
  - RRMesh::getTriangleMapping() extended to support multiple texcoord channels
  - RRMaterial::lightmapTexcoord added

    everything else is handled by default implementation of RRObject::getPointMaterial()
  - custom RRObject::getPointMaterial() implementations removed from adapters
  - RRMaterial::minimalQualityForPointMaterials replaces RRSideBits::pointDetails (no need to touch it)
  - Point materials in Collada and Quake3 scenes are used more often. For identical quality settings,
    new solver produces illumination of slightly higher quality in slightly longer time.
- RRMaterial::specularReflectance extended to support colors and textures
- realtime lights more flexible
  - rr_gl::RealtimeLight always contains RRLight

  - minor other changes in rr_gl::RealtimeLight
- RRObjects made more flexible
  - RRObjects::createLayer() creates empty buffers for whole layer
  - RRObjects::loadLayer() replaces RRObjects::loadIllumination()
  - RRObjects::saveLayer() replaces RRObjects::saveIllumination()

  \n rr_gl::sceneViewer() uses it by default
- in rr_gl::Camera, dir, right and up vectors are guaranteed to be orthonormal
  \n (previously they were denormalized and up was not orthogonal to dir)
- RRCollisionHandler::init() has new parameter that allows it to set required ray flags
  \n (caller is no longer reponsible for setting ray flags for collision handler)

CHANGES

- rr_gl::updateLightmapsWithDialog() removed, use more generic RRReporter::createWindowedReporter()
- in rr_gl::Camera, several variables were made private, use new get/setters to access them

\section news63 ------------------------------------ 2008.9.14 -------------------------------------

NEWS

- Light Detail Maps
  \n precomputed maps that greatly enhance precision of realtime GI at cost of single lookup in shader
  \n available in rr_gl::sceneViewer(), better example will follow
- extended rr_gl::sceneViewer(), it's possible to set initial camera and more than 20 other parameters.

   old code is incorrect now, it needs new parameter to be inserted between second and third one.

CHANGES

- extended RRMaterial, now it includes textures
  \n In your code, change material->diffuseReflectance to material->diffuseReflectance.color.

     implementation to your RRObject implementation.
  \n As adapter user, change mesh->getChannelData(RRMesh::CHANNEL_TRIANGLE_VERTICES_DIFFUSE_UV,...);
  \n to object->getChannelData(RRObject::CHANNEL_TRIANGLE_VERTICES_DIFFUSE_UV,...);
